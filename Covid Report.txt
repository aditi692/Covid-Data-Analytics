üìù COVID-19 Data Analytics ‚Äî Final Project Report
1. Introduction
COVID-19 had a major global impact, and analyzing real-time data can reveal how different countries responded and recovered. This project uses SQL and SQLite to explore a COVID-19 dataset. The aim is to identify trends like top affected countries, global statistics, and country-wise recovery and death rates.

2. Abstract
The COVID-19 Data Analytics project analyzes a global COVID-19 dataset using SQL queries. The dataset was imported from a CSV file and cleaned using SQLite. Various analytical queries were executed such as total confirmed cases, top affected countries, and death/recovery rates. The results were exported as .csv files, and the entire process was managed using DB Browser for SQLite.

3. Tools Used
SQLite ‚Äì Used to store and manage data

DB Browser for SQLite ‚Äì GUI tool for writing queries and viewing results

Kaggle Dataset ‚Äì country_wise_latest.csv dataset with country-wise COVID stats

Microsoft Excel (optional) ‚Äì For viewing exported CSV results

4. Steps Involved in Building the Project
Importing the Dataset
The Kaggle dataset was imported into SQLite using DB Browser.

Data Cleaning & Transformation
A clean table covid_clean was created with properly named columns and casted data types.

Writing Analytical Queries
SQL queries were written to find:

Top 5 countries by confirmed cases

Countries with highest death/recovery rates

Global totals (confirmed, deaths, recovered, active)

Exporting Results
The outputs of selected queries were exported to .csv format using DB Browser.

Final Folder Creation
All project files (SQLite DB, SQL queries, CSVs, and this report) were organized and uploaded to GitHub.

5. Conclusion
This project helped understand how to perform real-world data analysis using SQL. It involved data cleaning, transformation, writing queries, and interpreting results. The project enhanced skills in database handling and analytical thinking ‚Äî which are essential for data-related roles and interviews.
